# wildfires-protomaps

Let's build a self-hosted version of using Protomaps and Svelte.

Svelte is really just here for UI elements like a legend. This could pretty easily be vanilla javascript.

## Embed

Copy the following snippet into the CMS of your choice:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://hlydecker.github.io/sydney-trees/#4/39.82/-98.84"
  width="100%"
  height="450px"
  frameborder="0"
  title="Sydney Trees: 2017"
></iframe>
```

## Tree data

The tree data is generated with tools and models from our [aigis](https://github.com/sih/aigis) repository.
